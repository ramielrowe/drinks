# Mexican Mudslide

## Ingredients

 * Chocolate Liqueur - 1/2 oz
 * Coffee Liqueur - 1/2 oz
 * Horchata - 3/4 oz
 * 151 Spiced Rum - 3/4 oz

## Directions

 * Combine Chocolate and Coffee liqueur with Horchata
 * Pour over ice into a mixing tin
 * Pour in 151 Spiced Rum
 * Stir until chilled

## Notes

 * Make sure to pour in the 151 last as it's high alcohol content could curdle the horchata by itself.
 * Even with the 151 poured in last, the horchata could curdle, so you should drink this fast.
